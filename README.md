# init.el
This is my debian/macOS friendly emacs config. The place the init.el file in your ~/.emacs.d/ directory and my emacs config should be ready to go on your very own machine.

# macOS_setup
This is a script with some basic setup to get a clean macOS install up and running with a basic (but pretty) dev environment. Nothing too fancy.
Run the following lines in a terminal:
```
curl -fsSl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sreeladas/emacs/master/macOS_setup.sh > macOS_setup.sh
chmod u+x macOS_setup.sh
```

Open macOS_setup.sh in your fav text editor to make sure you're not going to break anything or add unwanted things -- if you work in bash, don't use my zsh setup, that kind of thing

```
./macOS_setup.sh
```
